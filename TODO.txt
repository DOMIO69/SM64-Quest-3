terrain doesnt get updated once its instantiated
-only meshcollider work


TODOS:
-allow grabbable terrain A by creating version B thats invisible and grabbable and updating A's position to be at B

-game crashes if a mesh is placed inside of mario (write code to prevent placement of blocks inside of mario)

-get textures from textures-resource.com and import them into the project. 
--Be able to load different levels textures to use as environment pieces.
